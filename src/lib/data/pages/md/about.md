## Thoughtful, Beautiful, Effortless ‚Äî That‚Äôs the Planner Bee Way üêù

Planner Bee is a small family-run company dedicated to helping you send beautiful, personalized e-cards with ease. Whether you're planning a birthday, baby shower, holiday dinner, or just want to send a heartfelt thank you, our mission is simple: to make your moments feel extra special.

## It All Started With a Simple Idea

Planner Bee was founded by Adrian and his wife, two people who always believed that the smallest gestures could leave the biggest impact. One evening, while trying to plan a celebration for their daughter, they realized how frustrating and uninspired most e-card platforms felt. The templates were generic, the editing tools limited, and the whole process felt like a chore when it should have felt like fun.
Planner Bee was founded by Adrian and his wife, two people who always believed that the smallest gestures could leave the biggest impact. One evening, while trying to plan a celebration for their daughter, they realized how frustrating and uninspired most e-card platforms felt. The templates were generic, the editing tools limited, and the whole process felt like a chore when it should have felt like fun.

So they rolled up their sleeves and decided to build something better from the ground up.

## A Labor of Love (and a Bit of Chaos)

What started as a side project quickly turned into a passion. Working late nights between bedtime stories and snack breaks, Adrian and his wife designed the very first version of Planner Bee: a simple, clean platform that made it easy to create stunning e-cards without any design experience.

From the start, their vision was clear:

- Make it **beautiful**
- Keep it **simple**
- Let people **make it their own**

That vision still guides everything we do.

## Built for Real Life

We know life is busy. Planning events, keeping in touch, and celebrating others shouldn‚Äôt be stressful. That‚Äôs why Planner Bee gives you tools that are powerful but approachable, with features like:

- **Customizable Templates** for every kind of celebration
- **Advanced Editing Tools** that don‚Äôt require a design degree
- **Automated Sending** so you can plan ahead and relax
- And **a personal touch** in everything we make

We want our cards to feel like _you_‚Äînot just another digital formality.

## Small Team, Big Heart

Planner Bee isn‚Äôt a big tech company. We‚Äôre not trying to be.  
We‚Äôre a small team that believes in building with care, listening closely to our users, and staying true to the things that matter: connection, creativity, and kindness.

Each feature we add and every template we design is handpicked, refined, and tested with love.

## Looking Ahead

Our journey is just getting started. We‚Äôre constantly dreaming up new ways to make Planner Bee more helpful, more delightful, and more _you_. We‚Äôre working on expanding our template library, adding new automations, and building better ways for you to manage all your events in one sweet spot.

Most of all, we‚Äôre just incredibly grateful you‚Äôre here with us.

**Thanks for supporting a small business with a big heart‚Äîand for letting us be a part of your celebrations, your stories, and your special moments.**

With love and lots of buzz,  
**‚Äì Adrian(CTO & Founder) & the Planner Bee Team**
